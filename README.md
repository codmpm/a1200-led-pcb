# A1200 LED PCB

This is a simple replacement for the original LED PCB of an Amiga 1200.

On refurbishment of my original PCB, some traces broke of as the thing is something around 30 years old ;-)
The only thing I've added, is the possibility to use 1206 33Î© resistor instead of the throuhg-hole ones.

If you want something more fancy or current, please check BiFrost oder other LED solutions from the different shops and people, who create them on the ever active amiga community, e.g. https://www.a1k.org/forum/.
